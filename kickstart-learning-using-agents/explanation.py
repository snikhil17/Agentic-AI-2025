    **Current Learning Phases:**

    **Task:** Create detailed explanation sections that correspond to each phase in the learning pathway. 
    Each explanation should be comprehensive and include:

    1. **Deep Concept Analysis**: Break down complex concepts into digestible parts
    2. **Hobby-Connected Examples**: Use analogies from {student_profile.get('hobby')} to make concepts relatable
    3. **Real-World Applications**: Show practical applications in {student_profile.get('domain')}
    4. **Common Pitfalls**: Explain what learners typically struggle with and how to avoid it
    5. **Progressive Building**: Show how each concept builds on previous knowledge
    6. **Hands-On Insights**: Provide actionable understanding that goes beyond theory

    **Format Requirements:**
    - Create one explanation section for each major concept/phase
    - Each explanation should be 200-400 words
    - Use clear, engaging language that matches the student's learning style
    - Include specific examples from their hobbies throughout
    - Focus on "why" and "how" rather than just "what"
    - Make each section standalone but connected to the overall journey

    Generate 5-7 comprehensive explanation sections that will replace the current basic explanations.
